# üìù Text Summarization and Topic Extraction

## üí° Group Project - Neural Network Module (Group 02)

#### This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload or paste text, summarize it using a Transformer-based model, and extract key topics using BERTopic.

## Steps Should Follow

### 1. Create a virtual environment
  ```
  python -m venv nlp-env
  ```
### 2. Activate the virtual environment

  ```
  cd nlp-env\Scripts\activate
  ```
### 3. creating .gitignore file

### 4. Install required libraries

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
### 5. Create the following Python files:

   pdf_processor.py ‚Äî For extracting text from PDF files.

   summarizer.py ‚Äî For generating text summaries using Transformer models.

   topic_modeler.py ‚Äî For extracting topics using BERTopic.

   app.py ‚Äî Main Streamlit application scrip

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

Topic Extraction: Selecting relevant key topics was challenging due to overlapping themes in similar documents.

Performance: Processing time increased with larger texts, especially during topic modeling.
